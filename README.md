## 💡 Recommendations

### Avoiding Button Conflicts

If you're using button combinations in your games (especially combinations involving the Guide/Home button), you may experience conflicts with other software that also monitors controller input.

**Common conflicts:**
- **Steam**: The Steam overlay intercepts the Guide button by default. To fix this, go to **Steam Settings → Controller** and disable **"Enable Guide Button"**.
- **Xbox Game Bar**: Windows' built-in Xbox Game Bar also uses the Guide button. You can disable it in **Windows Settings → Gaming → Xbox Game Bar**.
- **Controller companion apps**: Applications like DS4Windows, reWASD, or other controller mapping software may conflict with InputLayer. Consider disabling them or adjusting their settings to avoid double-mapping.

If your button combinations aren't working as expected, check whether any other software is intercepting the same buttons. You may need to disable or adjust those applications for InputLayer to function properly.
